        My name is Dominik and I build stuff. Mostly on the web. I always had an
        interest for coding, or, to be more precise on tech related things. My
        first contact with coding/scripting came with a game named World of
        Warcraft, some of you might know it! I liked writing my own
        scripts/macros and dabbled a bit with LUA to create my own add ons.
